Predicting the Bank marketing dataset through classification, If customer will subscribe to term deposit? (yes/no)

The Bank Marketing campaigns are one of the sales technique used for the banks to make business, Here we will take Data from a Portuguese banking institution, In this Report the goal is to predict If the client will subscribe to a term deposit. It will be using classification as the Main machine learning algorithm. This is an experimental dataset obtained from the UCI Machine learning Repository to practice different models of algorithms. This paper has also compared the main model along with rest of the models, however they all show similar accuracy which are nearing the predicted value. These are supported by Diagrams and charts involved in machine learning algorithms. The goal was predicted with help of K-NN classification with 90% accuracy score.
